# Neural Network Media Mix Modeling: 
## An Integrated Mediation Analysis Framework

## Introduction: Rethinking Media Mix Models Through Mediation Analysis

Media mix modeling traditionally attempts to directly map marketing spend to revenue, often treating the process as a black box. However, we know that marketing operates through a chain of effects: spend generates impressions, and these impressions then influence consumer behavior to drive revenue. This indirect pathway represents a classic mediation relationship, where impressions serve as the mediator between marketing investment and financial outcomes.

Traditional mediation analysis typically involves separate models for each relationship:
1. Modeling spend's effect on impressions
2. Modeling impressions' effect on revenue
3. Combining these effects to understand total impact

Our innovation lies in using a multi-stage neural network to integrate these traditionally separate steps into a single, cohesive framework. This unified approach allows the model to learn the entire causal chain simultaneously, capturing complex interactions and dependencies that might be missed when these relationships are modeled separately.

## The Multi-Stage Neural Network: A Unified Framework

Our architecture explicitly encodes the mediation structure through its stage design:

### Stage 1: Marketing Spend → Impressions
The first stage uses dense neural network layers to capture how different marketing channels generate impressions. This mirrors the first step of traditional mediation analysis but allows for non-linear relationships and interaction effects between channels.

### Stage 2: Impressions → Revenue with Time Consideration
A critical insight in marketing is that the relationship between impressions and revenue isn't instantaneous. Different channels may have varying lag effects - for example, a display ad might influence purchase decisions weeks after viewing, while a search ad might have more immediate impact. We use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers to capture these temporal dynamics, allowing the model to:
- Learn channel-specific lag patterns
- Account for cumulative exposure effects
- Adapt to varying response times across different markets and seasons

### Stage 3: Integrated Effects
The final stage combines both direct and indirect pathways, allowing the model to capture:
- Mediated effects (spend → impressions → revenue)
- Direct effects (spend → revenue)
- Cross-channel interactions
- Geographic variations

This integrated approach offers several advantages over traditional separated mediation analysis:
- Joint optimization of all parameters
- Consistent treatment of uncertainty
- Ability to capture complex interactions between stages
- More efficient use of data

## Implementation and Temporal Dynamics

The implementation acknowledges two key realities of marketing:

1. **Time-Lagged Effects**: Revenue often materializes days or weeks after marketing activities. Our LSTM layers explicitly model these temporal dynamics, learning:
   - Optimal attribution windows for each channel
   - Interaction effects over time
   - Seasonal patterns in response rates

2. **Geographic Heterogeneity**: Marketing effectiveness varies by region. Our model incorporates this through:
   - Regional dummy variables
   - Market-specific response patterns
   - Local temporal effects

## Technical Framework

The model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, leveraging modern deep learning capabilities to handle the complexity of integrated mediation analysis. Key technical features include:

```python
# Simplified architecture overview
spend_input = Input(shape=(sequence_length, n_features))

# Stage 1: Spend → Impressions
impressions = Dense(units)(spend_input)

# Stage 2: Time-Aware Impression → Revenue
temporal_effects = LSTM(units)(impressions)

# Stage 3: Combined Effects
combined = Concatenate()([spend_input, temporal_effects])
revenue = Dense(1)(combined)
```

## Business Impact

This integrated approach provides several advantages:

1. **More Accurate Attribution**: By modeling the entire causal chain simultaneously, we achieve more accurate attribution of revenue to marketing activities.

2. **Temporal Understanding**: The LSTM components reveal how different channels contribute to revenue over time, enabling better planning of marketing activities.

3. **Channel Interactions**: The unified framework captures how different marketing channels work together, rather than treating them independently.

4. **Actionable Insights**: The model provides clear guidance for:
   - Budget allocation across channels
   - Timing of marketing activities
   - Geographic targeting
   - Campaign optimization

## Future Directions

This framework opens several exciting avenues for future development:
- Incorporation of competitor activities
- Addition of more sophisticated market response curves
- Integration of customer journey data
- Extension to handle multi-product scenarios
